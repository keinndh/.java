Version 1 ( 03 - 05 - 2025)
------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to create a Hotel Room Reservation System
that allows users to view available rooms, book rooms, and check out by canceling
or completing the reservation. It simulates a hotel room booking system
that helps hotel managers track room availability, bookings, and customer details for Object-Oriented Programming.
